# Codecademy - Jammming Project - Built with React

## Project Overview



- <p>In this project, we build a React web application called Jammming. Uses knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Project Features

- Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account.

- Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button.

- Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user’s query.
Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track’s display container.

- Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a – sign on the right side of the track’s display container.

- Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.


## Resources 

Because we want you to focus on building the React infrastructure, we have provided links to the HTML/CSS and visual assets below. Notice, we did not break the HTML and CSS into their components. To complete the project you will need to split the HTML/CSS into their components.

index.html — all of the HTML for a static version of the website.

style.css — all of the CSS for a static version of the website.

image assets — all of the image assets used in the website.

## Built with
- React
- Git, GitHub
